* Idea
The simplest possible work distribution service.  It needs to be
simple to set up, simple to use, and reliable.

There are three kinds of participants: Clients, Workers and
Distibutors.  Workers and distributors are both servers and appear the
same to clients.
** Worker
A worker is a process doing actual computation work.
** Distributor
A distributor takes work from a client and ships it to one of its
workers.  If the worker dies, the computation is re-distributed.  The
distributor has a database of computations in progress and finished
computations, so if the distributor itself dies, it can restart
without any loss.  The record of a finished computation is deleted
once it's been shipped back to the client.
** Client
A client ships work to a server (either a worker directly or a
distributor).  For each computation it requests to be done it gets a
computation ID, with which it can request the result, which it
typically does immediately.  If the connection dies for whatever
reason, it will re-connect and re-request the result.  If everything
fails, it will do the computation locally.
* API
** Client
To connect to a server:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(connect server port)
#+END_SRC

=connect= returns a connection object.

To distribute some work one needs to get a distribution function from
the connection:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(worker-function connection name local-function)
#+END_SRC

=worker-function= returns a function that distributes the work or
calls the local function if that's not possible.  =name= can be any
value that has equality.  It should include not only the function
name, but also a version.  =local-function= is the local
implementation of the function.
* Protocols
There are two protocols: The protocol that a client uses to talk to a
server and the protocol that a worker uses to register with a
distributor and lets the distributor know about its workload (or maybe
the server knows enough - we might want to let a worker connect to
more than one distributor).
** Client-Server
*** Compute
The compute call takes a function name and an argument list.  The
server immediately returns a computation ID.
*** Ask
The ask call takes a computation ID and returns (after an indefinite
time) a result or an exception or an error.  An error can occur if the
server doesn't know about the computation ID, doesn't have the
function in question or has no computation capacity (which can only
occur for a distributor).  The computation only starts with the ask
call.
** Worker-Distributor
We might be able to make it even without those two calls, simply by
calling the workers in order of eligibility and using the first one
that doesn't return an error.
*** Register
The register call takes a function name.
*** Unregister
The unregister call takes a function name.
* Implementation
** Distributor
The distributor should have a web interface where it shows statistics.
** Serialization
Unfortunately, most Clojure classes are not serializable.  To make
them so, we need to substitute our own stand-in serializable class.
This means that when we serialize, we must create such a stand-in for
each Clojure object we encounter and when we deserialize, we must
replace the deserialized stand-in objects with the corresponding
Clojure objects.
*** Serializing
Serializing is more difficult because ObjectOutputStream refuses to
serialize objects not implementing the interface.  We must subclass
ObjectOutputStream and do the substitution in the writeObject method.
We should make sure that we preserve sharing.
*** Deserializing
We can use the readResolve method to substitute Clojure objects for
our stand-in objects.
